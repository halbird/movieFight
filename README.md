Practice accessing a web API of movie and TV show data. 
Custom-made autocomplete dropdowns to search for two movies. The movies are then compared next to each other, with the "winning" statistic shown in green. Data is accessed from the OMDB web API, available at http://omdbapi.com/.
API key removed for security.
